### Step-by-Step Deployment Process (Version 2)

This workflow is divided into two main phases: a one-time initial setup to create your custom AMIs, and then the rapid, repeatable deployments.

#### Phase A: Initial Lab Deployment & Configuration (One-time Setup to Create Golden AMIs)

This phase needs to be done *once* for each significant version of your configured lab.

1.  **Preparation (within `soc-lab-aws-v2/`):**
    * **Edit `soc-lab-aws-v2/terraform/terraform.tfvars`:**
        * Set your `ami_ubuntu_2204`, `ami_kali_linux`, `ami_windows_2019_base`, etc., variables to the **public, unconfigured base AMI IDs** from the AWS Marketplace or official sources. These are your starting points.
        * Ensure `your_public_ip` and `key_pair_name` are correctly set.
    * **Ensure `soc-lab-aws-v2/terraform/custom_amis.json` is empty `{}`.** (If it exists with old data, empty it for this fresh start).
    * Make sure `boto3` is installed (`pip install boto3`).
    * Navigate to the `soc-lab-aws-v2/` directory: `cd /path/to/soc-lab-aws-v2/`

2.  **Deploy the Base Lab (using `main.py`):**
    * Run `python main.py`.
    * Select `1` (Initialize Terraform).
    * Select `5` (Manage Specific Modules).
    * Enable **ALL** the modules by entering `1 2 3 4 5` and then `done`. This ensures all your desired VMs are part of the next `apply`.
    * Return to the main menu and select `3` (Apply Deployment).
    * Review the Terraform plan. **This will create new EC2 instances based on your *base AMIs***. Type `yes` to confirm.
    * **Wait for deployment to complete.** This might take some time as it's pulling fresh AMIs.

3.  **Configure Software Inside Running EC2 Instances (Crucial Manual Step):**
    * Go to your AWS EC2 Console. Wait for all instances to be in `running` state.
    * **Connect to each instance via SSH or RDP** using the `key_pair_name` you provided and your `your_public_ip`.
    * **Perform all necessary software installations and configurations:**
        * **Security Onion Instance:** SSH in. Run `sudo so-setup`, configure it as a `STANDALONE` deployment, choose your network interfaces, configure storage (`/nsm`), create admin users, and ensure web UI is accessible. (This is the most time-consuming part).
        * **Kali Linux Instance:** SSH in. Update packages (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`). Install any additional penetration testing tools you prefer. Configure your shell.
        * **REMnux Instance:** SSH in. Update (`sudo remnux-update`).
        * **Flare VM Instance:** RDP in. Ensure it's fully updated and configured. This often involves Windows Updates and verifying Flare VM's tools are installed.
        * **Windows Server/Workstation Instances:** RDP in. Install any enterprise applications you want to simulate. Install and configure log forwarding agents (e.g., Sysmon, Winlogbeat, or NXLog) to send logs to the Security Onion instance's *private IP address* (on the Blue Team Internal Network).
        * **Docker Host Instances (Blue Team, Red Team, IT Infra):** SSH in. Install Docker and Docker Compose. Pull down base images for the tools you intend to run (e.g., TheHive, Cortex, MISP for Blue Team Docker Host; Caldera, Covenant for Red Team Docker Host).
    * **Thoroughly test connectivity and log flow** between relevant lab components.

4.  **Capture Custom AMIs from Configured Instances (New Feature in `main.py`):**
    * With your configured instances still `running` in AWS, return to your `python main.py` script.
    * Select `7` (Capture Custom AMIs from Running Instances).
    * The script will list your running `SOCLab` instances.
    * It will prompt you to select which instances to snapshot. You can enter individual numbers (e.g., `1 3 5`) or type `all`.
    * The script will initiate the AMI creation process for each selected instance. **This can take significant time (10-30+ minutes per AMI)** as AWS needs to create snapshots of the root volumes. **Do NOT terminate instances during this process.**
    * Upon completion, the script will show the new AMI IDs and automatically update your `soc-lab-aws-v2/terraform/custom_amis.json` file.
    * **Important:** The AMI captures the *root volume only*. If you have a separate `/nsm` data volume for Security Onion, its data won't be part of the AMI. For `/nsm` data persistence, you would need to manage its EBS snapshot separately and restore it to a *new* EBS volume attached to the launched SO instance (more advanced, usually done for persistent data stores, not for ephemeral labs). For a fresh lab session, starting with a clean `/nsm` is often desired.

5.  **Destroy the Initially Deployed Lab:**
    * After the AMIs are successfully created and `custom_amis.json` is updated, return to the `main.py` menu.
    * Select `4` (Destroy Deployment). This will terminate all the currently running EC2 instances and associated resources.
    * Confirm `yes`. This is essential to stop incurring high compute costs.

#### Phase B: Rapid Deployment using Custom AMIs (Repeatedly, Faster)

From now on, when you want to use the lab, you'll follow this quick deployment process.

1.  **Run `python main.py`.**
2.  **Select `1` (Initialize Terraform).** (Always a good habit before `plan`/`apply`).
3.  **Select `5` (Manage Specific Modules):** Enable only the modules you need for this particular lab session (e.g., `1` for core, `2` for Blue Team, `5` for IT Infra). Type `done`.
4.  **Select `3` (Apply Deployment):**
    * Terraform will now read `custom_amis.json` (which was updated in Phase A).
    * It will launch new EC2 instances directly from your pre-configured custom AMIs.
    * **Observe the speed!** This step should be significantly faster (minutes vs. hours) as no in-guest configuration is being performed.
    * Confirm `yes`.
5.  **Lab Ready:** Your lab is now ready to use with all software pre-installed and configured!

#### Phase C: Clean Up (Cost Saving)

When you're finished with a lab session, **destroy the resources to avoid incurring continuous AWS costs.**

1.  **Run `python main.py`.**
2.  **Select `4` (Destroy Deployment):** This will terminate all the currently running EC2 instances and associated resources.
    * Confirm `yes`.
3.  **(Optional) Destroy Specific Modules:** If you only deployed certain modules, you can use `5` to disable them first, then `4` to destroy just those.

## üîí Security Considerations

### Pros

* **Isolated Environment:** Deploying the lab within a dedicated AWS VPC provides strong network isolation from your production AWS resources and the broader internet.
* **Controlled Access:** Security Group rules are designed to limit SSH/RDP access primarily to your public IP, reducing exposure.
* **Learning Platform:** Provides a safe and disposable environment to practice offensive and defensive security techniques without impacting real systems.
* **Scalability & Elasticity:** Leverage AWS's cloud capabilities to easily scale resources up or down as needed for different lab scenarios.

### Cons

* **Cost:** Running EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and EBS volumes incurs AWS costs. Monitor your AWS billing dashboard regularly and **destroy resources when not in use**.
* **Public IP Exposure:** The NAT instance and potentially other jump boxes might have public IPs. Ensure strict security group rules are in place.
* **Default Credentials/Hardening:** The deployed instances will likely have default configurations. It is crucial to implement proper security hardening (changing default passwords, applying patches, configuring host-based firewalls, etc.) for any long-running lab components.
* **AMI Security:** The security of your lab depends on the base AMIs you choose. Always select trusted, updated AMIs.
* **Log Forwarding Security:** Ensure secure protocols (e.g., TLS) are used for log forwarding to Security Onion.

## ‚úÖ Pros and Cons of this Automation Approach

### Pros

* **Streamlined Deployment:** Simplifies the complex multi-step process of deploying a full lab environment into a simple menu-driven interface.
* **Consistency:** Eliminates manual errors by automating Terraform commands.
* **Modularity:** Allows focused deployment/destruction of specific lab components without affecting others.
* **State Management:** Helps maintain a clean `main.tf` by dynamically commenting/uncommenting modules, reducing the risk of accidental deployments.

### Cons

* **File Modification:** The Python script modifies `main.tf` directly. While designed to be safe, any unexpected interruptions or manual edits during script execution could lead to `main.tf` being in an inconsistent state.
* **Dependency on Python:** Requires a Python environment and specific libraries (`colorama`).
* **Limited Error Context:** While error messages are displayed, debugging complex Terraform issues still requires understanding Terraform's output and potentially inspecting the state file manually.
* **No Parallelism:** The current script deploys/destroys modules sequentially.
